 The background should include scattered, hand-drawn doodles related to {subject}, evenly distributed across the banner. These doodles should have a sketch-like, freehand styleâ€”simple outlines with slight variations to give a natural, artistic feel. Maintain a clean and uncluttered composition with balanced negative space.

 Prominently display the subject name "{subject}" in a playful, hand-drawn or slightly rounded font that complements the doodle style. Ensure the text is clear, well-integrated into the design, and does not overpower the background elements.

Use light, pastel, or neon-like doodles and accents to contrast against the dark background while maintaining a soft, eye-soothing look. The doodles should be outline-style, scattered evenly across the banner, and related to {subject}. Ensure they follow a freehand, sketch-like aesthetic for a fun yet minimal appearance.

Prominently display the subject name "{subject}" in a complementary light color that stands out against the dark background. The font should be playful, slightly rounded, or hand-drawn to match the doodle style.

The final design should be visually balanced, with negative space to avoid clutter, and must not include any logos.""")
