      "heading": "Limitations of Gauss-Elimination",
      "content": "The limitations of the Gauss-Elimination method are:\n1. Round off error.\n2. Pivoting issues (if pivot = 0 or poor near 0).\n3. Computational costs: This method involves O(n^3) operations, making it computationally expensive for large systems.\n4. Static system: Cannot handle systems with dynamically changing coefficients or iterative improvements."

    {
      "heading": "Comparison of Gauss Elimination with Iterative Methods",
      "content": "Gauss elimination has a computational cost of O(n^3) while iterative methods have a computational cost of O(n^2). Gauss elimination is sensitive to round off errors, while iterative methods can achieve a desired precision. Gauss elimination is less efficient for large systems, while iterative methods are scalable and efficient for large systems."

      "heading": "Condition for Diagonal Dominance",
      "content": "For a system of linear equations represented by Ax=b, the coefficient matrix A is diagonally dominant if for every row i: |aii| >= sum(|aij|) with strict inequality |aii| > sum(|aij|)."
    },
    {
      "heading": "How Diagonal Dominance Ensures Convergence of Gauss-Seidel",
      "content": "Diagonal dominance ensures that the iterative updates do not diverge. Each new estimate of the variable depends more on its coefficient and less on the other variables, promoting stability. This condition helps the system converge because the contribution of the off-diagonal terms are small compared to the diagonal terms."

    {
      "heading": "Comparison of Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel Methods",
      "content": "Jacobi updates variables simultaneously, while Gauss-Seidel updates variables sequentially. Jacobi has slower convergence compared to Gauss-Seidel, which has faster convergence due to the immediate use of updated values. Jacobi requires strong diagonal dominance, while Gauss-Seidel converges under milder conditions."
